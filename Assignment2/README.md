# Assignment 2 (UNO browser client + domain)

Mirrors the `yahtzee-graphql` layout: shared UNO domain and a Vue client, with the monochrome black/gray/white styling from Assignment 5.

## Structure
- `domain/` – UNO domain model.
- `client/` – Vue + Pinia UI with the monochrome theme.

## Getting started
```bash
npm install               # installs all workspaces
npm run dev -w client     # start the Vite dev server
```
